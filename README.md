# The-Explorer
The Explorer is fun and intuitive way to consume a large corpus of data through clever visualization

The Explorer is a web-app that provides an interactive map of the complete
geographical world. This interactive map has a timeline that allows the user to
move through time at a certain location, and the map displays events that have
occurred at that point in time at that location. These events are not restricted to a
historical perspective, but also have events in different genres like political,
educational, biological , literary events. These events can be filtered based on user
choice. These events further give more information about the event on click.

Essentially the map encompasses information from the evolution of life on earth
to different political reforms to independence movements of different countries.
The map utilizes text analysis to scrape data off of the web, verify the data, sort
the data according to genres and times and then offers a rich and intuitive map
interface to serve the user with the interactive map with all of this information. It
also provides a recommendation system based on user history ( personalization ) .
